                                <p>IEEE SB Chapter IIT Mandi in collaboration with IEEE PES-IAS Delhi Section, National Service Scheme (NSS) and Society for collaborative Research and Innovation (SCRI) successfully celebrated the IEEE Day in Himalayan Region through “Do it Yourself Workshop on Solar Lamp” with a theme of Solar Energy for Future conducted at Government School named Nalan Govt. School. This project was a part of the Global IEEE day Celebration by IEEE SB Chapter IIT Mandi and IEEE Delhi Section, NSS and SCRI.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The activity is to deliver a talk on non-renewable and renewable energy sources, after the awareness talk, there would a small hands-on session on assembling a portable solar lamp. The students of Nalan Govt. school showed high interest in making the solar lamp and the complete solar lamp has been majorly made by students itself. Though, the IEEE volunteers helped them as per their individual need. Once the students have completed the task then the solar lamp has been hand over to them as a memento and further awareness about how the solar lamp generate energy from the solar.</p> 
                                            <p>The project focused on creating awareness among the 10th Standard students about renewable energy and its sources and assembling a portable solar lamp by each student. Altogether, 15 kids from 10th class with the four faculty members from the school participated in this event.
                                    The team provided dismantled parts of the solar lamp to school students and they were curiously engaged in making the lamp. Lots of questions in young minds started to emerge, as they started making the solar lamp. The volunteers were also engaged with the individual students to quench their thrust of knowledge and helping them in assembling the parts. The students took approximately one and a half hour to complete the project and at the last, the moment came of which we all were waiting for, the gleams of triumph, affection and aspiration in their eyes with the glow of the solar lamp as they switched it on for green energy. After all, we saw a keen sense of attraction for solar energy in these innocent, happy and blooming young minds.</p>

                                    <p>A 2 days long quadcopter workshop was organized by IEEE IAS SB Chapter IIT Mandi in collaboration with SkyFi Labs, sponsored by IEEE student branch chapter IIT Mandi and IEEE IAS-PES chapter of Delhi
                                    Section. It was conducted on 16th and 17th November 2019. Initial lecture session of 3 hrs duration helped to get a good understanding of rotary-wing aircraft and their dynamics. Students were then divided into a team
                                    of 5 members and they worked in cooperation to build the drone. Workshop saw good participation from 1st
                                    year and 2nd year students engaging in fabricating the quadcopter and assembling electronics. It gave an
                                    exposure to Design and concepts of Embedded Systems behind multicopters. At the last, calibration and
                                    proper testing of the developed quadcopter was done and each student was given a chance to fly their built
                                    drones in testing ground.</p>

                                    School Students by IEEE IIT Mandi</h3>
                                    <p>IEEE SB Chapter IIT Mandi in collaboration with IEEE PELS Delhi Section, National Service
                                    Scheme (NSS) and Society for collaborative Research and Innovation (SCRI) successfully celebrated the
                                    IEEE Day in Himalayan Region through “Hands-on Workshop on Solar Powered Lamp for School
                                    Students” with a theme of Solar Energy for Future conducted at Government School named Nishu Govt.
                                    School on 31 st October 2019. This project was a part of the Global IEEE day Celebration by IEEE SB
                                    Chapter IIT Mandi and IEEE Delhi Section, NSS and SCRI.
                                    The activity is to deliver a talk on non-renewable and renewable energy sources, after the awareness
                                    talk, there would a small hands-on session on assembling a portable solar lamp. The students of Nishu
                                    Govt. school showed high interest in making the solar lamp and the complete solar lamp has been majorly
                                    made by students itself. Though, the IEEE volunteers helped them as per their individual need. Once the
                                    students have completed the task then the solar lamp has been handed over to them as a memento and
                                    further awareness about how the solar lamp generate energy from the solar.</p> 
                                    <p>The project focused on creating awareness among the 17 th  Standard students about renewable
                                    energy and its sources and assembling a portable solar lamp by each student. Altogether, 17 kids from
                                    10 th  class with the four faculty members from the school participated in this event.
                                    The team provided dismantled parts of the solar lamp to school students and they were curiously
                                    engaged in making the lamp. Lots of questions in young minds started to emerge, as they started making
                                    the solar lamp. The volunteers were also engaged with the individual students to quench their thrust of
                                    knowledge and helping them in assembling the parts. The students took approximately one and a half hour
                                    to complete the project and at the last, the moment came of which we all were waiting for, the gleams
                                    of triumph, affection and aspiration in their eyes with the glow of the solar lamp as they switched it on for
                                    green energy. After all, we saw a keen sense of attraction for solar energy in these innocent, happy and
                                    blooming young minds.</p>

                                        This event provides an opportunity to prove programming supremacy amidst
                                        brilliant coders by bringing in the best solution to the given problem statement
                                        in the limited amount of time using machine learning and deep learning. It is
                                        basically a programming dilemma to bring out the best accepted elucidation.</p>
